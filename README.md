### Hi! I'm Aditi üçµ (she/her)!

I work as a Firmware Engineer and usually write low level C and assembly platform code for wireless devices,
though I also dabble in bit of Perl and Python, mostly to write little tools. I love listening to music as I work.

I'm trying to get back to programming as a hobby after a break of nearly a decade.
